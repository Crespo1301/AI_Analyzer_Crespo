/*
 * AI Analyzer, 2026-27 NFL season. Pre-game model predictions.
 *
 * This file holds MODEL PREDICTIONS that have not been graded yet. Each entry
 * captures what ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini said pre-kickoff, including the
 * timestamp so the record is auditable (picks existed before the game).
 *
 * Lifecycle: as soon as a game plays and gets graded, the game + bets get
 * promoted into NFL_GAMES / NFL_BETS in assets/nfl-data.js and removed from
 * (or marked "played" in) this file. This file stays a pre-game archive so
 * picks are not silently altered after outcomes are known.
 *
 * Reset note (2026-09-09): the initial Week 1 lockup on 2026-09-08 was
 * discarded before kickoff because the prompt methodology did not honor the
 * blind-test intent and did not leverage each model's real strengths (Claude
 * and Codex can read local repo data, Gemini can read the public GitHub URL,
 * all three can research online). New prompts live in Prompts/2026/templates/.
 * Predictions will populate here once fresh model runs complete.
 *
 * Source responses live in Docs/Responses/2026/week-XX/game-YY-<slug>/
