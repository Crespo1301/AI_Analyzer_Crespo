## 📚 Key Lessons Learned

### What This Upset Teaches:

1. **Beware Overconfidence**: 80%+ win probabilities should be rare, especially in division games

2. **Respect Underdogs**: Motivated division rivals on the road can surprise

3. **Coming Off Bye ≠ Win**: Lions were rusty/overconfident after bye week

4. **Rookie QBs Can Deliver**: McCarthy's 3rd start was successful (2 pass TDs, 1 rush TD)

5. **Focus on Value**: OVER had better edge than chasing the spread

6. **Acknowledge Variance**: High variance games have upset potential - Model #3 was only one to note this

7. **Score Predictions Matter**: Model #3 predicted 27-23, actual was 24-27 (just reversed winner!)

## 💡 Why This Matters

This analysis demonstrates the value of:

1. **Realistic Confidence Levels**: Models that acknowledge uncertainty perform better
2. **Variance Awareness**: Recognizing high-variance situations is crucial
3. **Value Betting**: Focus on bets with best statistical edge, not favorites
4. **Post-Game Analysis**: Learning from actual results improves future predictions
5. **Transparency**: Honest assessment of what went wrong builds credibility

**Model #3's approach of modest confidence, variance awareness, and focus on the OVER total proved superior to the overconfident, Lions-heavy approaches of Models #1 and #2.**

## 🎓 For Future Analyses

When creating new analyses, consider:

- Adding "With Results" versions after games complete
- Comparing predictions to actuals for accountability
- Highlighting which models' bets won/lost
- Including lessons learned from surprises
- Using color coding (green = correct, red = wrong)
- Showing actual profit/loss for betting recommendations

This creates a complete feedback loop and helps users understand which models/approaches work best.
