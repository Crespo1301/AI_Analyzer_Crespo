### Model #1 Evaluation

**Predictions:**
- Win Probability: Lions 78%, Vikings 22%
- Most Probable Score: Lions 31, Vikings 17
- Smartest Bet: UNDER 47.5
- Lions Cover -8.5: 54%

**Results:**
- ❌ **Win Prediction: WRONG** - Predicted Lions win, Vikings won
- ❌ **Score Prediction: WRONG** - Off by 14 points for Lions (31 vs 24), off by 10 for Vikings (17 vs 27)
- ❌ **Smartest Bet: WRONG** - Recommended UNDER, game went OVER (51)
- ❌ **Spread Prediction: WRONG** - Said 54% chance Lions cover, Lions lost outright
- ❌ **Total Prediction: WRONG** - Said UNDER hits 58%, OVER actually hit

**Category Scores:**

| Category | Score | Reasoning |
|----------|-------|-----------|
| Win Prediction Accuracy | 0/10 | Complete miss - predicted wrong winner with 78% confidence |
| Score Accuracy | 2/10 | Total was close (48 predicted vs 51 actual) but individual scores very wrong |
| Bet Quality | 0/10 | Recommended UNDER with "HIGH confidence" - it lost |
| Spread Analysis | 1/10 | Said 54% cover rate (coin flip) but Lions lost outright |
| Variance Assessment | 3/10 | Identified key variables but underestimated Vikings' chances |
| Statistical Rigor | 6/10 | Good use of stats and simulation methodology |
| Confidence Calibration | 0/10 | "HIGH confidence" on wrong bet, 78% on wrong winner |

**Overall Score: 17.1/100**

**What Went Wrong:**
- Massively overestimated Lions' dominance (78% win probability)
- Underestimated McCarthy's ability to perform in his 3rd start
- Didn't account for Lions coming off bye being rusty/overconfident
- Wrong on the smartest bet with high confidence

- ✓ **Lions Score: ACCURATE** - Predicted 27-38, actual was 24 (just under range)

**Category Scores:**

| Category | Score | Reasoning |
|----------|-------|-----------|
| Win Prediction Accuracy | 0/10 | Wrong winner, even higher confidence than Model 1 (80-85%) |

| Statistical Rigor | 7/10 | Good statistical comparisons and metrics |
| Confidence Calibration | 0/10 | Highest confidence of all models, completely wrong |

**Overall Score: 17.1/100**

**What Went Wrong:**
- Even more confident than Model 1 in wrong outcome
- Called it "one of the most significant mismatches of the week" - it wasn't
- Overvalued Lions' home field advantage

### Model #3 Evaluation

**Predictions:**
- Win Probability: Lions 59%, Vikings 41%

- Smartest Bet: OVER 47.5 (59% probability)
- Score Ranges: Lions 12-40, Vikings 8-35

**Results:**
- ❌ **Win Prediction: WRONG** - Predicted Lions but with more reasonable 59% confidence
- ✓ **Score Prediction: CLOSEST** - Predicted 27-23, actual was 24-27 (just flipped!)
- ✓ **Smartest Bet: CORRECT** - Recommended OVER 47.5, it hit (51 total)
- ✓ **Total Prediction: CORRECT** - Said OVER hits 59%, it did hit
- ✓ **Variance Assessment: CORRECT** - Acknowledged high variance, upset happened

**Category Scores:**

| Category | Score | Reasoning |
|----------|-------|-----------|
| Win Prediction Accuracy | 4/10 | Wrong winner but acknowledged 41% Vikings chance (not dismissive) |
| Score Accuracy | 8/10 | Predicted 27-23, actual 24-27 - essentially perfect, just reversed |
| Bet Quality | 10/10 | Recommended OVER 47.5, it hit (51 points) |
| Spread Analysis | 7/10 | Said only 42% cover rate (implied Vikings had chance) |
| Variance Assessment | 9/10 | Explicitly noted high variance and possibility of upset |
| Statistical Rigor | 8/10 | Transparent methodology, realistic modeling |
| Confidence Calibration | 9/10 | Appropriately modest confidence levels |

**Overall Score: 78.6/100**

**What Went Right:**
- Only model to recommend the winning bet (OVER)
- Score prediction was remarkably accurate (just wrong winner)
- Acknowledged Vikings had a real shot (41%)
- Correctly identified high variance potential
- Honest about model limitations

**What Went Wrong:**
- Still predicted Lions win (though with less confidence)

## Comparative Analysis

### Accuracy Rankings:

1. **Model #3: 78.6/100** - Only one to get the smartest bet correct
2. **Model #1: 17.1/100** - Wrong on everything, especially the key bet
3. **Model #2: 17.1/100** - Wrong with highest confidence

### Key Insights:

**Why Model #3 Won:**
- **Humility in Predictions**: 59% vs 78-85% confidence showed better calibration
- **Variance Awareness**: Explicitly acknowledged high variance and unpredictability
- **Betting Focus**: Focused on the OVER as the bet with best edge
- **Score Accuracy**: 27-23 prediction vs 24-27 actual was incredibly close
- **Methodology**: Transparent simulation with acknowledged limitations

**Why Models #1 & #2 Failed:**
- **Overconfidence**: 78-85% win probability was too high
- **Dismissive of Vikings**: Didn't give McCarthy/Vikings enough credit
- **Wrong Bet Selection**: Both focused on Lions-heavy bets
- **Underestimated Variance**: Called it low variance when it was high
- **Home Field Overvalued**: Lions coming off bye were rusty

### Betting Results:

| Model | Recommended Bet | Result | Profit/Loss* |
|-------|-----------------|--------|--------------|
| Model #1 | UNDER 47.5 (-110) | LOSS | -$110 |
| Model #2 | Lions -8.5 (-110) | LOSS | -$110 |
| Model #3 | OVER 47.5 (-110) | WIN | +$100 |

*Assuming $100 wager per bet

**Net Result: Model #3 was +$320 better than the other two models!**

## Lessons Learned

**Model #3's Winning Formula:**
- Realistic probability assessment
- Focus on totals over sides when variance is high
